<h2>Project: Math Wizard</h2> 
<h3>Description</h3>

This program is a study project that demonstrates my general knowledge of Python programming, and it includes three main functions: finding the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD), the Least Common Multiple (LCM), and prime factorization of a number.

 <h3>This program has three main functions:</h3>

1.  The Greatest Common Divisor (GCD): This function calculates the largest positive integer that divides two or more given integers leaving no remainder. For example, the GCD of 8 and 12 is 4. The GCD function uses prime factorization to calculate the result. For more information on GCD, please see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor)
    
2.  The Least Common Multiple (LCM): This function calculates the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of two or more given integers. For example, LCM(2,3) = 6 and LCM(6,10) = 30. The LCM of two or more numbers is the smallest number that is evenly divisible by all numbers in the set. The LCM function also uses prime factorization to calculate the result. For more information on LCM, please see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple)
    
3.  Prime Factorization: This function calculates the set of prime numbers which multiply together to result in a given number. Prime factorization is the process of breaking down a number into its prime factors. For example, the prime factors of 24 are 2, 2, 2, and 3. For more information on prime factorization, please see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization)
    

The Math Wizard program allows users to input two or more integers and calculates the GCD, LCM, and prime factors of those integers. The program also checks the user input for errors such as non-integer inputs or negative numbers. If an error is detected, the program will display an appropriate error message.
