##Description
###This program has three main functions
1) The Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two or more integers, when at least one of them is not zero, is the largest positive integer that is a divisor of both numbers. For example, the GCD of 8 and 12 is 4. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor
2) The Least Common Multiple (LCM). For two integers a and b, denoted LCM(a,b), the LCM is the smallest positive integer that is evenly divisible by both a and b. For example, LCM(2,3) = 6 and LCM(6,10) = 30. The LCM of two or more numbers is the smallest number that is evenly divisible by all numbers in the set. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple
3) Prime factorization of a number is breaking a number down into the set of prime numbers which multiply together to result in the original number. This is also known as prime. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization
